# CrewAI Pipeline Integration & UI Enhancement Plan

**Senior Dev Plan** | **Priority: HIGH** | **Estimated Timeline: 3-4 days**

## Executive Summary

Based on analysis of `plan.md`, `implementation.md`, and existing codebase, significant infrastructure has been built but is not properly integrated with the UI's enhanced validation system. This plan addresses:

1. **Pipeline Integration**: Remove mock/fallback systems, enforce full CrewAI pipeline usage
2. **UI Enhancements**: Improve UX for material input and agent transparency  
3. **Missing Agent Integration**: Connect all implemented agents (Pre-Validation, Web Search & Ingest, Explanation Loop) to the pipeline
4. **Documentation Sync**: Update architecture documentation to reflect actual implementation

---

## Current State Analysis

### ✅ **What's Already Implemented** (from codebase analysis)
- **Pre-Validation Agent**: Complete with blacklist, structural validation (`lib/validation/pre-validation.ts`)
- **Web Search & Ingestion**: Queue-based system with multi-vendor support (`app/api/items/search_ingest/route.ts`)
- **Explanation Loop**: Agent-powered explanation verification (`app/api/items/explain/route.ts`)
- **LLM Classifier**: Content validation with Langfuse integration (`lib/validation/llm-classifier.ts`)
- **Rule Engine**: Enhanced with explanation workflows (`lib/rule-engine/rule-agent.ts`)
- **Database Schema**: Complete with migrations for `item_validation_events`, `external_item_sources`, `line_item_explanations`
- **API Endpoints**: All 5 endpoints from implementation.md specification

### ❌ **Integration Gaps Identified**
- Enhanced validation API (`/api/validate-enhanced`) still uses simplified mock approach
- CrewAI pipeline not using the full 6-agent system (missing Pre-Validation, Web Search, Explanation agents)
- UI shows generic agent list instead of actual pipeline execution traces
- AGENT_ARCHITECTURE.md outdated - missing new agents and workflows
- Feature flags not properly connected to UI workflow
