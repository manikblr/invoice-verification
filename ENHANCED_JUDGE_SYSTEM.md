5. **Maintain prompts**: Keep Langfuse prompts updated and versioned
6. **Test thoroughly**: Use integration tests to verify evaluation accuracy

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **LLM Judge Unavailable**: System falls back to rule-based evaluation
2. **Langfuse Connection Issues**: Check credentials and network connectivity
3. **High Evaluation Latency**: Consider reducing evaluation complexity or caching
4. **Inconsistent Scores**: Review judge prompts and criteria for clarity

### Debug Mode

Enable detailed logging by setting environment variables:
