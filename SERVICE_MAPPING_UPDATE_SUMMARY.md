# Service Line and Service Type Mapping Update - COMPLETED

## 📊 Summary

**Date**: August 24, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ **SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED**  
**Senior DB Engineer**: Claude Code

## 🎯 Objective
Update the service lines and service types mapping in the Supabase database to correct numerous incorrect mappings identified by the user, using the corrected data from `Updated Service line and type mapping.csv`.

## 📋 Database Analysis

### Before Update:
- **Service Lines**: 24 (including duplicates like "Hvac" and "HVAC")
- **Service Types**: 1000 (many incorrectly mapped to wrong service lines)
- **Issues**: 
  - Duplicate service lines ("HVAC" appeared twice)
  - Service types mapped to wrong service lines (e.g., plumbing types under electrical)
  - Inconsistent naming conventions

### After Update:
- **Service Lines**: 23 (cleaned up duplicates)
- **Service Types**: 1000+ (correctly mapped according to updated CSV)
- **Improvements**:
  - All duplicates removed
  - Correct service line → service type relationships
  - Added 139 new properly-mapped service types
  - Standardized naming ("HVAC" instead of "Hvac")

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### 1. Database Schema Analysis
- ✅ Analyzed existing `service_lines` and `service_types` tables
- ✅ Identified foreign key constraints to `canonical_items` table
- ✅ Planned safe update strategy to avoid constraint violations

### 2. Data Backup & Safety
- ✅ Created comprehensive backup: `service_data_backup_safe_[timestamp].json`
- ✅ Implemented safe update approach (update-in-place vs delete-and-recreate)
- ✅ Preserved all existing references and relationships

### 3. Service Lines Cleanup
- ✅ **Merged HVAC duplicates**: Combined "Hvac" (ID 5) and "HVAC" (ID 24) into single "HVAC" entry
- ✅ **Moved service types**: All service types from duplicate IDs moved to primary IDs
- ✅ **Deleted duplicates**: Safely removed duplicate service line entries
- ✅ **Standardized naming**: Ensured consistent naming conventions

### 4. Service Types Remapping
- ✅ **Updated 420 core mappings** from the corrected CSV file
- ✅ **Added 139 new service types** that were missing
- ✅ **Preserved existing relationships** with canonical_items
- ✅ **Maintained referential integrity** throughout the process

### 5. New Service Line Distribution
Based on the updated mapping from CSV:

| Service Line | Service Types Count | Key Services |
|---|---|---|
| **Handyman** | 49 types | Assembly, Building Maintenance, General Carpentry |
| **Landscaping** | 42 types | Tree Maintenance, Mowing, Irrigation |
| **HVAC** | 41 types | A/C Repair, Heating Systems, Ductwork |
| **Construction** | 34 types | Concrete Work, Flooring, Structural Repairs |
| **Appliances** | 33 types | Installation, Repair, Maintenance |
